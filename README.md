This consists repositoty contains the functionality for transcribing TurnTheBus video files. All the code exists in ```transcribe.py``` file. The main function is ```transcribe_all```. It iterates through every video file in AWS S3 bucket ```INPUT_BUCKET_NAME``` and starts the transcription job by calling AWS Transcribe Service asynchronously. All the transcription output is stored in ```OUTPUT_BUCKET_NAME``` as individual json files. The code doesn't start a transcription job if the corresponding transcript file already exists in the output bucket. ```transcribe_all``` is wired to run as an AWS Lambda function.
